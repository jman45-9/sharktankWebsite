        <p id="copeBio">Hi, my name is Jeremy Cope and I am one of the founders of Speedy Clean. 
            I have an MIT Masters degree in mechanical engineering and web design. I also have experience in 
            creating cleaning products. We were motivated to create this product so our keyboards can 
            stay clean while we game or work while inevitably snacking.
